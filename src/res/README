We implemented the following extensions:

1)  Avatar with walking animation. The code for this is at Avatar.draw().

2)  Nigh mode. Press 'N' to switch to night mode. Code can be found at Game.init() for setting up the light
    and at Avatar.keyPressed().

3)  Sun movement. Press 'R' and 'T' to rotate the sun. Code at Game.display(), Avatar.keyPressed().

To change the view from 1st person <--> 3rd person, press the space bar.

The file test8 was used to test the tardis object.
